# C - Dynamic libraries

> This project was an introduction to Dynamic libraries in C.

## Summary

I learnt about dynamic libraries, how they work, how to create and use them, the differences between static and shared libraries. Also, the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it and how to use `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- []():
- []():
- [main.h](): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions used in the project.

> - [test_files](): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
> - [functions](): A folder of functions for the task.
