# C - Dynamic libraries

> This project was an introduction to Dynamic libraries in C.

## Summary

I learnt about dynamic libraries, how they work, how to create and use them, the differences between static and shared libraries. Also, the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it and how to use `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [libdynamic.so]():
- [1-create_dynamic_lib.sh]():
- [main.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x18-dynamic_libraries/main.h): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions used in the project.

> - [test_files](): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
> - [functions](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x18-dynamic_libraries/functions): A folder of functions for the task.
