# C - Hello, World

> This project was an introduction to C.

## Summary

I learnt about who invented C, the "entry point" in a program, what is `main`, how to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`, using the unary operator `sizeof`. I also learnt compilation using `gcc` and the steps involved and the various outputs of these steps.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor): A bash script that runs a C file, saved in the variable `$CFILE`, through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file, named `c`.
- [1-compiler](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler): A bash script that compiles a C file, saved in the variable `$CFILE`, but does not link. The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.o` instead of `.c`.
- [2-assembler](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler): A bash script that generates the assembly code of a C file, saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
- [3-name](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name.c): A script that compiles a C file, saved in the variable `$CFILE`, and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- [4-puts.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c): A C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `puts`.
- [5-printf.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c): A C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line using the function `printf`.
- [6-size.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c): A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- [100-intel](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel): bash script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file, saved in the variable `$CFILE`. The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension `.s` instead of `.c`.
- [101-quote.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c): a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error without using any functions listed in the `NAME` section of `man (3) printf` or `man (3) puts`.

> - [test_files](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world/test_files): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
