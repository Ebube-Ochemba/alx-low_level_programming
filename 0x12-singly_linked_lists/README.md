# C - Singly linked lists

> This project was an introduction to singly linked lists.

## Summary

I learnt about how to build and use linked lists and the difference between linked lists and arrays.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [0-print_list.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/0-print_list.c): Prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
- [1-list_len.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/1-list_len.c): Returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- [2-add_node.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/2-add_node.c): Adds a new node at the beginning a of a `list_t` list.
- [3-add_node_end.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/3-add_node_end.c): Adds a new node at the end of a linked `list_t` list.
- [4-free_list.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/4-free_list.c): Frees a `list_t` list.
- [100-first.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/100-first.c): Prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` function is executed.
- [101-hello_holberton.asm](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/101-hello_holberton.asm): 64-but assembly program that prints `Hello, Holberton` followed by a new line using only the `printf` function witout interrupts.

> - [lists.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x12-singly_linked_lists/lists.h): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
