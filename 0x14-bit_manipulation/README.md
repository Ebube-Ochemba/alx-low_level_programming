# C - Bit manipulation

> This project was an introduction to Bit manipulation in C.

## Summary

I learnt about Bit manipulation, Bitwise operators and thier application.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [x] [0-binary_to_uint.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c): Converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.
- [x] [1-print_binary.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x14-bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c): Prints the binary representation of a number.
