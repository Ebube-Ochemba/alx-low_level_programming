# C - Functions, nested loops

> This project was an introduction to using functions and nested loops. 

## Summary

I learnt about variable scope in C, nested loops, using standard header files and defining custom ones as well. Also, declaring and defining functions and also using them.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.
