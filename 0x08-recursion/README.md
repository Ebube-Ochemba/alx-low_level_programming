# C - Recursion

> This project was an introduction to recursions in C.

## Summary

I learnt about recursion in C, how to implement it and the right situation to apply it.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [x] [0-puts_recursion.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/0-puts_recursion.c): Prints a string, followed by a new line.
- [x] [1-print_rev_recursion.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/1-print_rev_recursion.c): Prints a string in reverse.
- [x] [2-strlen_recursion.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/2-strlen_recursion.c): Returns the length of a string.
- [x] [3-factorial.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/3-factorial.c): Returns the factorial of a given number.
- [x] [4-pow_recursion.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/4-pow_recursion.c): Returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.
- [x] [5-sqrt_recursion.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/5-sqrt_recursion.c): Returns the natural square root of a number.
- [x] [6-is_prime_number.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/6-is_prime_number.c): Checks in an integer is a prime number.
- [x] [100-is_palindrome.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/100-is_palindrome.c): Checks if a string is a palindrome.
- [ ] [101-wildcmp.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/101-wildcmp.c): Compares two strings `s1` and `s2`.
	- `s2` can contain the special character `*`.
	- If the strings can be considered identical, the function returns `1`.
	- Otherwise, the function returns `0`.

> - [main.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x08-recursion/main.h): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
> - [test_files](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x08-recursion/test_files): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
