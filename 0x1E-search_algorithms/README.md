# C - Search Algorithms

> This project was Search Algorithms.

## Summary

I learnt about Search Algorithms; linear search, binary search and what the best search algorithm to use is, depending on your needs.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

> Each of the *-O files contains the big O notations of the time/space complexity of a given search algorithm.
