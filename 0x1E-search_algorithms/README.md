# C - Search Algorithms

> This project was Search Algorithms.

## Summary

I learnt about Search Algorithms; linear search, binary search and what the best search algorithm to use is, depending on your needs.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

> Each of the *-O files contains the big O notations of the time/space complexity of a given sorting algorithm.

- [ ] [0-linear.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/0-linear.c): A function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the `Linear search` algorithm.
- [ ] [1-binary.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/1-binary.c): A function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the `Binary search` algorithm.
- [ ] [2-O](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/2-O): The `time complexity` (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size `n`.
- [ ] [3-O](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/3-O): The `space complexity` (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size `n`.
- [ ] [4-O](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/4-O): The `time complexity` (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size `n`.
- [ ] [5-O](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/5-O): The `space complexity` (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size `n`.
- [ ] [6-O](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/6-O): The `space complexity` of this function/algorithm.
