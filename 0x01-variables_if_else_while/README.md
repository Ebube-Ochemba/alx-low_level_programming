# C - Variables, if, else, while

> This project was an introduction to variables, operators, conditionals and loops in C.

## Summary

I learnt about; variables and how to declare them and assign values to them, Keywords and identifiers. Arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C and how to use them. Implementing `if`, `if ... else` statements as well as `while` loops. Also, more about the `gcc` and the `-m32` and `-m64` flags, comments in code and using a linter.

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c): Assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
	- [Source code](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c) to be completed.
- [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c): Assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Prints whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n` is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0.

- [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c): Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c): Prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times. 
- [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c): Prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.
- [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c): Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
- [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c): Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice without any variables of type `char`.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c): Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.
- [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c): Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times.
- [9-print_comb.c)](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c): Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without any variables of type char:
- [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c): Prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`.
- [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c): Prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by a comma, using `putchar`, without using a variable of type `char`.
- [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c): Prints all possible different combinations of two two digit numbers, separated by a comma, using `putchar`, without using a variable of type `char`.
