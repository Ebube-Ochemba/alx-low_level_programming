> This project was more about the compilation process. 

## Summary

I learnt about macros and how to use them. Also, the most common predefined macros and how to include guard your header files.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.
