# C - Preprocessor

> This project was more about the compilation process. 

## Summary

I learnt about macros and how to use them. Also, the most common predefined macros and how to include guard your header files.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [x] [0-object_like_macro.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/0-object_like_macro.h): A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
- [x] [1-pi.h)](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h): A header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
- [x] [2-main.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c): Prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.
- [x] [3-function_like_macro.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h): A header file that defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
- [x] [4-sum.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h): A header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

> - [test_files](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0D-preprocessor/test_files): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
