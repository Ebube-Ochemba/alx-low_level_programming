# C - Static libraries

> This project was an introduction to static libraries.

## Summary

I learnt about static libraries, how they work, how to create one using `ar`, `ranlib`, `nm` and how to use them.
## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [create_static_lib.sh)](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x09-static_libraries/create_static_lib.sh): Bash script that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.
- [libmy.a](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x09-static_libraries/libmy.a): A static library containing all the functions used in the project.
- [main.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x09-static_libraries/main.h): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions used in the project.

> - [test_files](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x09-static_libraries/test_files): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
> - [functions](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x09-static_libraries/functions): A folder of functions for the task.
