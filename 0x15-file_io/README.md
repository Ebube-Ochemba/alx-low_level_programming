# C - File I/O

> This project was an introduction to File I/O in C.

## Summary

I learnt about how to create, open, close, read and write files, the three standard file descriptors and their `POSIX` names as well as the difference between function and system calls. I practiced using the I/O system calls `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write` and the flags `O_RDONLY`, `WR_ONLY`, and `O_RDW` to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.
