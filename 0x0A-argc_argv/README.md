# C - argc, argv

> This project was an introduction to command line arguments.

## Summary

I learnt about tilizing arguments passed to C functions with `argc` and `argv` as well as how to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `void` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [0-whatsmyname.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/0-whatsmyname.c): Prints its name, followed by a new line.
	- If the program is renamed, the program will print the new name without having to be compiled again.
- [1-args.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/1-args.c): Prints the number of arguments passed into it.
- [2-args.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/2-args.c): Prints all arguments it receives.
- [3-mul.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/3-mul.c): Multiplies two numbers passed to the program as arguments.
- [4-add.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/4-add.c): Adds all numbers passed to the program as arguments.

> - [main.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-argc_argv/main.h): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
