# C - Pointers, arrays and strings

> This project was an introduction to pointers, arrays and strings.

## Summary

I learnt about pointers, arrays, strings and how to use them.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.

## Files

> Each file contains the solution to a task in the project.

- [0-reset_to_98.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c): Takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.
- [1-swap.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c): Swaps the value of two integers.
- [2-strlen.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c): Returns the length of a string.
- [3-puts.c)](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c): Prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.
- [4-print_rev.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c): Prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
- [5-rev_string.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c): Reverses a string.
- [6-puts2.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c): Prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- [7-puts_half.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c): Prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
- [8-print_array.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c): Prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
- [9-strcpy.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c): Copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
	- Returns the pointer to `dest`.
- [100-atoi.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c): Converts a string to an integer without using `long`, new variable arrays, or hard-coded special values, as follows:
	- The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters.
	- Takes into account all `+` and `-` signs before the number.
	- If there are no numbers in the string, the function returns `0`.
- [101-keygen.c](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c): Generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x04.c).

> - [main.h](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/main.h): A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
> - [test_files](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/test_files): A folder of test files. Provided by Alx.
