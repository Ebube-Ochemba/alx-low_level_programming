# C - Structures, typedef

> This project was an introductiion to C structures and typedef.

## Summary

I learnt about structures, when, why and how to use them. Also how to use `typedef`.

## Requirements

- Standard libraries are not allowed, except specified. `printf`, `puts`, etc.
- Allowed to use [`_putchar`](https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c): A
C custom function that writes a character to `stdout`, provided by Alx.
